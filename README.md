This Fiji/ImageJ macro makes use of thresholding and particle analysis functions in imagej.
It is designed to load image panels and roi-zip files with marked axons to apply a defined threshold and count recognised particles with defined parameters.
It aims to facilitate semi-automated counting of synaptic aggregates in neurons.
